            <h1 id="title">Hi! I am NOT a bot.</h1>
            <p>The internet is not dead. There are still people out there, and I am one of them.

                <br />
                <br />
                My name is Pietro. I remember being given a username as a child: pietrod (Pietro D.). It
                sounded like pietroid, so I adopted it ever since. Ironic, my bot name comes from my human name.
                Whatever,
                <br />
                <br />

                Under the era of mechanized life, everything is just an automatic process. But life is not automatic,
                it's chaotic and ever changing.

                <br />
                <br />

                "The book of changes". When I read it briefly, talking about Yin-Yang, I couldn't not think about the
                nature of computer science. What is a modern computer if not the simplest representation of change? 0 vs
                1. Hegel would love, contradiction at its finest.

                <br />
                <br />

                "I'm a programmer, so everything is just yes or no". I heard someone saying that once. I was
                horrified. The exact point of computer science is to be able to create higher abstractions out of 0 or
                1. Why we have data types, data structures, etc?

                <br />
                <br />

                So we are mistaking tool by the goal. The tool is binary, but the goal is to solve human problems. When
                we mistake it, we are trying to shape reality to fit the tool. Imagine if the 1970s engineers said that
                they
                couldn't calculate a sum of some data because there was just 0 or 1.

                <br />
                <br />

                Let's remember that the goal is to solve HUMAN problems. Machines are just ways to direct our energy,
                but the information comes purelys from us. If artificial intelligences were not fed with thousands and
                thousands of years of culture, it couldn't generate much thing alone.


                <br />
                <br />

                Culture: It's our ordered chaos, the human experience integrated across all generations. When I say
                integrate, is both a systemic thing (integrate all parts) but also can be considered as the sum of
                everything (as in calculus).

                <br />
                <br />

                Survived in the form of culture, the past lifes have condensed as petroleum, and it is now a rich
                material for data
                processers that are able to extract the essence of it. But the essence is not the data, it's the human
                experience encoded within it.

                <br />
                <br />

                Anyway, why I'm here? I like to hear stories, and like to tell stories (I'm trying to be better at
                this). Maybe the write is a better way to express myself.

                <br />
                <br />

                Hope this gives a little more bit of hope and pleasure from what we do.
