            <h1 id="title">I'm Pietro! I am NOT a bot.</h1>
            <p>The internet is not dead. There are still people out there, and I am one of them.

                <br />
                <br />
                My name is Pietro. I remember being given a username as a child: pietrod (Pietro D.). It
                sounded like pietroid, so I adopted it ever since. Ironic, a bot name comes from my human name.
                Whatever,
                <br />
                <br />

                Under the era of mechanized life, everything is just an automatic process. But life is not automatic,
                it's chaotic and ever changing.

                <br />
                <br />

                "I Ching - The book of changes". When I read it briefly, talking about Yin-Yang, I couldn't not think
                about the
                nature of computer science. What is a modern computer if not the simplest representation of change? 0 vs
                1.

                <br />
                <br />

                "I'm a programmer, so everything is just yes or no". I heard someone saying that once. I was
                horrified. The exact point of computer science is to be able to create higher abstractions out of 0 or
                1. Why do we have data types, data structures, etc?

                <br />
                <br />

                We are mistaking tool by the goal. The tool is binary, but the goal is to solve human problems. When
                we mistake it, we are trying to shape reality to fit the tool. Imagine if the 1970s engineers said that
                they couldn't go to the moon because the universe was not binary.

                <br />
                <br />

                Our goal should be to solve HUMAN problems. Machines are just ways to direct our energy,
                but the information comes purely from us. If artificial intelligences were not fed with thousands and
                thousands of years of culture and human knowledge, it couldn't generate much thing alone.


                <br />
                <br />

                Culture: It's our ordered chaos, the human experience integrated across all generations. Past lifes have
                condensed as petroleum of wisdom, and it is now a rich
                material for data processers. The knowledge is not in the data itself, it's in how we translate those
                data
                into our humane, day-to-day life.

                <br />
                <br />

                That's precisely why I like to hear stories, and to tell stories (getting better at
                this). That's why I'm here, trying to share a little bit of my own stories on software engineering,
                mathematics, philosophy, and whatever comes to mind.

                <br />
                <br />

                In the era of lifeless automatons where creativity barely exists, maybe this blog gives a little bit
                of
                hope and pleasure from what we do.
