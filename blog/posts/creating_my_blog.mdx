title: How I created my blog from scratch with vanilla JS, MDX Remark and Github Pages
date: 2025-06-25
---

I already did in the past a [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) based blog to write about my travel to Egypt (check this [here](https://pietroid.github.io/egypt-travelogue/)). I didn't want to spend too much time, so I made a solution with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) + Github pages, [the recommended approach from Github](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll).

However, I got a bit disappointed in the way things didn't seem so simple to configure. I ended up needing to create a [jekyll theme](https://jekyll-themes.com/pietroid/egypt-travelogue-jekyll-theme) just to tune some CSS and make my blog look like I wanted, but the worst thing is that a lot of things I was doing kind of bindly, because it was based on Ruby and I am not familiar with it.

For my official dev blog, I wanted something simple and at the same time powerful, so I could evolve it step by step. After researching a bit I found some candidates such as [Astro.js](https://astro.build/), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (examples: [Next.js with React](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/blog/how-i-built-my-blog/), [Next.js with Tailwind](https://gaudion.dev/blog/nextjs-mdx-blog)).

Althought they seem to be highly configurable and well-maintained I felt that I still missed something about the process of doing it simpler. So I decided to try to build my own blog from scratch, using plain Javascript. I missed the days I tinkered with things and built them from scratch, so I saw it as a good opportunity to ressurrect that feeling.

# Getting to the basics

Instead of vibe-coding, I wrote what I really wanted. The requisites were:

1. The solution should process [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) so I don't bother myself with HTML/CSS every time I write a post
2. It should deploy simply from a push to github repository so I don't bother to use any CMS or database
3. It should be extensible and allow specific HTML/CSS in place if needed for demos/cool things I might wanna do in my website (for example, embedded a Flutter Web piece of code).

## MDX

MDX is an extension on Markdown files that enables to render html and JSX inside the markdown content (https://mdxjs.com/). By the documentation, we can use its mdx-js lib to load any mdx and transform into a jsx document. Basically we could use a line of code like this to render a MDX file:

```
const compiled = await compile(await fs.readFile('example.mdx'))
```

## Github MDX

I am used to writing MDX in the format Github usually recognizes, so that would be nice if I could use some parser that recognizes this.

Luckily, this is readily mentioned on the [MDX guides section](https://mdxjs.com/guides/) (it's so simpler to just read the documentation), and now we dive into an interesting rabbit hole.

## Remark

Actually to render Github MDXs we need to use `remark`, and what is [remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark)?

> _**remark**Â is a tool that transforms markdown with plugins. These plugins can inspect and change your markup. You can use remark on the server, the client, CLIs, deno, etc._

Interesting. Digging more I found a beatiful piece of code:

```
import rehypeSanitize from 'rehype-sanitize'
import rehypeStringify from 'rehype-stringify'
import remarkParse from 'remark-parse'
import remarkRehype from 'remark-rehype'
import {unified} from 'unified'

const file = await unified()
  .use(remarkParse)
  .use(remarkRehype)
  .use(rehypeSanitize)
  .use(rehypeStringify)
  .process('# Hello, Neptune!')

console.log(String(file))
```

We can attach multiple kinds of plugins, on demand ([this is the list of the plugins](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/blob/main/doc/plugins.md#list-of-plugins), a LOT). We can also write custom plugins to do whatever we want with the markdown and the HTML content.

# Starting with the generator

Finding what I really wanted, I started to build a simple generator that would read the MDX files and generate HTML files from them. The concept is to have three separate folders:

1. `/blog`: where the MDX files are stored
2. `/builder`: where the generator lives.
3. `/compiled`: where the generated HTML files will be stored to be consumed on the final website.

The most basic generator code looks like this:

```javascript
import fs from 'fs';
import path from 'path';
import { processBlogPost } from './processor.js';

/// Create the `compiled` folder
fs.mkdirSync('../compiled', { recursive: true });

/// List blog files
var files = fs.readdirSync('../blog/posts');

for (var file of files) {
    /// Read the file content
    var content =
        fs.readFileSync(path.join('../blog/posts', file), 'utf8');
    
    /// process the file content
    var processedPost = await processBlogPost(content);

    /// Write the processed file to compiled folder
    var filename = file.split('.')[0];
    var renderedFilename = filename + '.html';
    fs.writeFileSync(path.join('../compiled/posts', renderedFilename), processedPost);
}
```

And the secret lies inside the `processBlogPost` function:

```javascript
import { unified } from 'unified';
import remarkParse from 'remark-parse';
import remarkRehype from 'remark-rehype';
import rehypeStringify from 'rehype-stringify';

/// Transforms each blog post (as MDX) into HTML.

export async function processBlogPost(content) {
    var processed = await unified()
        .use(remarkParse)
        .use(remarkRehype)
        .use(rehypeStringify)
        .process(content);

    return String(processed);
}
```

What are the plugins the `processBlogPost` function is using?

- `remarkParse`: Parses the markdown content into an abstract syntax tree (AST).
- `remarkRehype`: Converts the markdown AST into a HTML AST.
- `rehypeStringify`: Converts the HTML AST into a string of HTML.

What I love about this is that it is so simple to understand and extend. If I want to add a plugin, I just need to add it to the chain of plugins in the `processBlogPost` function. 

And that's precisely what we needed, because with just this simple function, you probably noticed that we have just a plain simple HTML page, without any styling or anything around its content.

## Styling and scaffolding

I created a simple HTML scaffolding that will be used to wrap the content of the posts. The idea is to have a simple HTML file that will be used as a template for each post, and then we can insert the content of the post inside a specific place in that template. The advantage is that this file already comes with the stylization as well.

To be able to use that, I created a plugin that does the following:

- Receives the HTML AST of the post
- Receives the HTML AST of the scaffold
- Replaces the content of the scaffold with the content of the post
- Adds the title of the post to the scaffold 

```javascript
import { visit } from 'unist-util-visit';

function addScaffold(options) {
    const { scaffold } = options;

    return function (tree, file) {
        var contentTree = {};

        /// Move properties from the original tree to contentTree
        Object.assign(contentTree, tree);

        /// Delete all properties from the original tree
        Object.keys(tree).forEach(key => delete tree[key]);

        /// Add the scaffold to the tree
        Object.assign(tree, scaffold);

        // Find the node with the id 'post-content' inside the 
        visit(tree, 'element', (node) => {
            if (node.properties && node.properties.id === 'post-content') {

                /// Adds the contentTree to the whole post tree
                node.children = contentTree.children

                // Adds the title 
                node.children.unshift({
                    type: 'element',
                    tagName: 'h1',
                    properties: {
                        'id': 'title',
                    },
                    children: [
                        {
                            type: 'text',
                            value: file.data.frontmatter.title || 'No title provided'
                        }
                    ]
                });
            }
        })
    }
}
```

## Reading the title from the MDX file

You might be wondering how to read the title from the MDX file. The way we usually put that kind of information is using a frontmatter, which is a YAML block at the beginning of the MDX file. We can not only put the title there, but also other metadata such as date, author, etc. That is the front-matter of this post:

```mdx
---
title: How I created my blog from scratch with vanilla JS, MDX Remark and Github Pages
date: 2025-06-25
--- 
```

To be able to read that, we can use the `remark-frontmatter` and `remark-parse-frontmatter` plugins. They will parse the frontmatter and make it available for the next plugins. To access this data, we can use the `file.data` structure, as instructed on the plugin documentation.

# Putting everything together

The final `processBlogPost` function looks like this:

```javascript
import { unified } from 'unified';
import remarkParse from 'remark-parse';
import remarkRehype from 'remark-rehype';
import rehypeStringify from 'rehype-stringify';
import remarkFrontmatter from 'remark-frontmatter';
import remarkParseFrontmatter from 'remark-parse-frontmatter';

export async function processBlogPost(content, scaffold) {
    var processed = await unified()
        .use(remarkParse)
        .use(remarkFrontmatter, ['yaml'])
        .use(remarkParseFrontmatter)
        .use(remarkRehype)
        .use(addScaffold, { scaffold: scaffold })
        .use(rehypeStringify)
        .process(content);

    return String(processed);
}
```

The scaffold is provided from the main generator code and is a very simple script that reads the `index.html` file from the `post_scaffold` folder and converts it into a HTML AST that will be used to wrap the content of the post.

## The index page

Now, another similar challenge is to have a dynamic index page. Most of it will be static content, but we want to have a list of all the posts that were generated so you all can easily navigate through the past posts.

The approach is very similar, but in this case we just need to read the index and insert a list of links inside a specific `div`:

```javascript
export async function processIndex(content, allPostsFrontmatter) {
    var processed = await unified()
        .use(rehypeParse, { fragment: false })
        .use(addPostLinks, { allPostsFrontmatter: allPostsFrontmatter })
        .use(rehypeStringify)
        .process(content);

    return String(processed);
}

/// Add links to the posts in the index page.
/// The links will be added to the node with the id 'post-links'.

function addPostLinks(options) {
    const { allPostsFrontmatter } = options;

    return function (tree) {
        // Find the node with the id 'post-links'
        visit(tree, 'element', (node) => {
            if (node.properties && node.properties.id === 'post-links') {
                // Clear existing children
                node.children = [];
                // Add links to each post
                allPostsFrontmatter.forEach(post => {
                    node.children.push({
                        type: 'element',
                        tagName: 'a',
                        properties: {
                            href: `posts/${post.filename}.html`
                        },
                        children: [
                            {
                                type: 'text',
                                value: `${post.date} - ${post.title}`
                            }
                        ]
                    });
                    node.children.push({
                        type: 'element',
                        tagName: 'br',
                        properties: {}
                    });
                    node.children.push({
                        type: 'element',
                        tagName: 'br',
                        properties: {}
                    });
                });
            }
        });
    }
}
```

We extracted the frontmatter from each post and passed this list to the `processIndex` function (`allPostsFrontmatter`), which will generate the HTML for the index page. The `addPostLinks` function will then add links to each post inside the `div` with the id `post-links`.

# Last step: deploying to Github Pages

One quick way to upload a site that I liked to use a lot is github pages. I like the way everything is integrated, you can use a github action and publish something on the page itself, and we don't have to worry about hosting files and configuring pipelines. 

There should be better solutions, but this is one where I will stick because of familiarity and it gives me what I want.

## Custom pipeline

One thing that I actually not liked was to using the default github pages recommendation, Jekyll. Although seemingly well [documented](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll), it seemed confused and I didn't have the feeling I knew what was going on.

## Understanding github pages

Github pages is not really clear on how it does all its processes. But it basically takes a branch and can, via some action, transform into a static site that will be consumed by github pages.

[Here is the doc](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/using-custom-workflows-with-github-pages) explaining what needs to be done. We just need a simple action that does things such as:

```yaml
jobs:
  # Build job
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Setup Pages
        id: pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v5
      - name: Build with Jekyll
        uses: actions/jekyll-build-pages@v1
        with:
          source: ./
          destination: ./_site
      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3

  # Deployment job
  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{steps.deployment.outputs.page_url}}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

The build stage produces the static contents and the deploy effectively sends the content to the github pages server using the `actions/deploy-pages@v4`
