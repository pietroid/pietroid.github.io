A simple blog with MDX.

I already tried in the past for a traveling blog to Egypt (check this here) a solution with Jekyll + Github actions (the recommended for doing github sites), but was a little disappointed on the way things didn't seem too easy to do.

Doing the traditional software development benchmarking and research (AKA googling), on "What's the best way to configure a blog with MDX?", I found multiple suggestions.

- Next.js with React ([example](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/blog/how-i-built-my-blog/))
- Next.js with Tailwind ([example](https://gaudion.dev/blog/nextjs-mdx-blog))
- Next.js github pages ([example](https://santhalakshminarayana.github.io/blog/build-blog-with-nextjs-mdx-and-deploy-to-github-pages))
- Astro.js (https://astro.build/)

I even found one exotic solution with rust (reference).

But, let's be real: it shouldn't be that complex.

## Getting to the basics

What my solution should do is simple:

1. Should process MDX so I don't bother myself with HTML/CSS every time I write a post
2. Should deploy simply from a push to github repository so I don't bother to use any CMS or database
3. Should be extensible and allow HTML/CSS in place if needed for demos/cool things I might wanna do in my website (for example, add a Flutter Web piece of code)

# MDX

MDX is an extension on Markdown files that enables to render html and JSX inside the markdown content (https://mdxjs.com/)

By the documentation, we can use its mdx-js lib to load any mdx and transform into a jsx document.

What it does is basically:

```
const compiled = await compile(await fs.readFile('example.mdx'))
```

It converts to this piece of js:

```
import {Fragment as _Fragment, jsx as _jsx, jsxs as _jsxs} from 'react/jsx-runtime'

export function Thing() {
  return _jsx(_Fragment, {children: 'World'})
}

function _createMdxContent(props) {
  const _components = {h1: 'h1', ...props.components}
  return _jsxs(_components.h1, {children: ['Hello ', _jsx(Thing, {})]})
}

export default function MDXContent(props = {}) {
  const {wrapper: MDXLayout} = props.components || {}
  return MDXLayout
    ? _jsx(MDXLayout, {...props, children: _jsx(_createMdxContent, {...props})})
    : _createMdxContent(props)
}
```

That would be used on an actual file rendered by the browser.
## Github MDX

I am used to writing MDX in the format Github usually recognizes, so that would be nice if I could use some parser that recognizes this.

Luckily, this is readily mentioned on the [MDX guides section](https://mdxjs.com/guides/) (it's so simpler to just read the  documentation, AI prompters...), and now we dive into an interesting rabbit hole.

## Remark

Actually to render Github MDXs we need to use a `remark` , and what is [remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark)?

> **remark**Â is a tool that transforms markdown with plugins. These plugins can inspect and change your markup. You can use remark on the server, the client, CLIs, deno, etc.

Interesting. And reading more I found a beatiful piece of code:

```
import rehypeSanitize from 'rehype-sanitize'
import rehypeStringify from 'rehype-stringify'
import remarkParse from 'remark-parse'
import remarkRehype from 'remark-rehype'
import {unified} from 'unified'

const file = await unified()
  .use(remarkParse)
  .use(remarkRehype)
  .use(rehypeSanitize)
  .use(rehypeStringify)
  .process('# Hello, Neptune!')

console.log(String(file))
```

Seems very interesting because we can attach multiple kinds of plugins, on demand ([this is the list of the plugins](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/blob/main/doc/plugins.md#list-of-plugins), a LOT). I think it can help me leverage the #3 requirement.

# Styling and Scaffolding

We can add any style or add any other data to the documents, such some button to the home or some list of blog contents. 

The point of using any package or library is essentially the ability to have out-of-the-box pre-configured app architecture/hierarchy. For example:

- a
- b
- c

In this case, we also want the most simplistic one. As I want to do almost everything from scratch or using the most flexible and simplistic solutions, I want, for the first phase:

- A home page
- For each blog page:
	- A header
	- A footer

There are some things also cool to tackle such as:

- Easy to create and locate images
- Manageable paths and URLs


# Github pages

One quick way to upload a site that I liked to use a lot is github pages. I like the way everything is integrated, you can use a github action and publish something on the page itself, and we don't have to worry about hosting files and configuring pipelines. 

There should be better solutions, but this is one where I will stick because of familiarity and it gives me what I want.

## Custom pipeline

One thing that I actually not liked was to using the default github pages recommendation, Jekyll. Although seemingly well [documented](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll), it seemed confused and I didn't have the feeling I knew what was going on.

## Understanding github pages

Github pages is not really clear on how it does all its processes. But it basically takes a branch and can, via some action, transform into a static site that will be consumed by github pages.

[Here is the doc](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/using-custom-workflows-with-github-pages) explaining what needs to be done. We just need a simple action that does things such as:

```yaml
jobs:
  # Build job
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Setup Pages
        id: pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v5
      - name: Build with Jekyll
        uses: actions/jekyll-build-pages@v1
        with:
          source: ./
          destination: ./_site
      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3

  # Deployment job
  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{steps.deployment.outputs.page_url}}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

The build stage produces the static contents and the deploy effectively sends the content to the github pages server using the `actions/deploy-pages@v4`


# Wrapping everything up

- Creating custom repository
- Creating simple local generator with MDX
- Adding the scaffolding and styling
- Configuring action
- Uploading the first page


## Creating custom repository

Per the github tutorial, you must just add a custom .github.io repository that it will be able to deploy directly as your own github page.

I just created this repository with a index.html and it rendered the simplest site possible

## Creating custom local builder 

For now, what needs to be done for the builder is fairly simple:

1. Read a series of posts in MDX format inside some folder
2. Compile each one of them inside a separate html page
3. Generate a home page that references all those posts

### 1. Reading posts inside folder

Let's create a posts
