## Godel, Escher and Bach: On the Eternal Golden Braid

This is one of my favorite books. I don't know, but its ethos ressonates much with what I think from science. I always liked science as a fun way to see the world. Its true investigative nature is first of all, curious and inventive. Of course we needed it in the first place to be able to survive, but in the process we discover the beauty of the world.

Fenyman, nobel winning physicist and one of my favorites, once said: "Physics is like sex: sure, it may give some practical results, but that's not why we do it."

This book brings a fun way to see patterns on the world. Shining through the lens of great geniuses who were able to capture some of this "dance of the universe".

## Music, Geometry and Logic

The book centers on three main themes: the Music from Bach, the Geometric drawings from Escher and the Logic from Godel. 

Why? Bach is highly geometric on its music, with symmetries, repetitions and inversions. Escher defeats our logic with geometric illusions. And Godel shows us the true nature of those illusions.

## Godel's Incompleteness Theorem

It's one of the most fascinating theorems in mathematics. When Godel proved it back in 1930, mathematics wanted to build a complete mathematical system. One of the greatest projects on mathematics, to be able to build a system formally consistent. 

It meant that everything within that system could be proven. It was just a matter of time to mathematics to be able to prove everything.

But Godel showed that this was impossible. There are true statements that cannot be proven.

## Escher's drawings

Escher's drawings are a great example of how we can be fooled by our own logic. He creates impossible objects, like the Penrose triangle, and plays with our perception of space and time.

He creates drawings that seem to defy the laws of physics, but are actually just clever tricks of perspective.

Escher's work is a great reminder that our perception of reality is not always accurate. We can be fooled by our own logic, and we need to be careful when interpreting the world around us.
